# My-Hackpad-From-Hack-Club-Blueprint-

**Built for Hack Club** 

This is my first ever build from scratch. This is a macropad with 6 keys, made by using the tutorial provided by Hack Club.

My name is **Agam**, and I am a sophomore student. I want to be some kind of engineer, so when I saw this project I thought I would a shot at it to learn how a PCB works, schematic, and the softwares. 

I mainly used **KiCad** for the schematic and the main PCB wiring. Then I moved onto **Fusion 360**, working on the bottom and top case to house the microcontroller and everything else. 

## What Everything Is

### 1. Schematic

This was the first step in making my macropad. You can find the screenshots of the Schematic in the folder named "Screenshots". Below, I have the images just incase you want to see them!

### 2. PCB

The was the second step in making my macropad. As with the schematic, you can find the image in the folder named "Screenshots". Image is also below!

### 3. Case_Files
These are 3D files that are printable that hold the PCB and keys, which makes everything work together in the macropad

### 4. Keyboard_Keycaps
This is the file which are the dimensions of the actual Cherry MX Keycaps, so the case fits on top of the keys.

### 5. Case Screenshots (Fusion 360)

### 6. main.py
This is the code file for the keyboard, which allows the keyboard to be properly coded and work with my laptop. I just used the code from Blueprint, however I am still trying to learn how to code this properly so I can make future projects.

# BOM
1 Seeed XIAO RP2040

6 Cherry MX-style switches

6 Keycaps

4 Screws

4 Heatset inserts

1 3D printed case (find the CAD files in /case)

Thank you for checking out my macropad project!
